# Worm bosons

This is our class project, where we realize that all bosons are actually just fermions.

The program in main.cpp can be compiled and run on its own using the command

```
g++ -O3 -o main main.cpp
```

while run-worm.py is a script that generates all the data and plots for each part of the project, by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding sections of the script.
